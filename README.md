# JoyMakers

During engineering studies, a website was developed to serve as a vital link between generous donors and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). This platform facilitates users in specifying the items they wish to donate, while enabling NGOs to access and benefit from this information. This was accomplished mainly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP etc.
