            Clothes donation refers to the act of giving away clothing items that are no longer needed or wanted to individuals or organizations that can benefit from them. It is a charitable practice aimed at helping those in need, promoting sustainability, and reducing waste. People often donate clothes to support various causes, such as assisting the homeless, aiding disaster victims, or supporting low-income families.
